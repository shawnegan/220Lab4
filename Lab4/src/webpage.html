			A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're 
			an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important 
			to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. 
			Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.
			</p>
			<h3>Feeding your Dog </h3>
			<p>Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult 
			dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may 
			enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these 
			additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food 
			intake.
			</p>
			<h3>Exercise</h3>
			<p> Exercise your dog regularly to keep your dog stimulated and healthy,
			and to keep their weight in check.  Different breeds need different 
			levels of exercise. Before adopting a dog, research the energy level of
			the breed to ensure you will be able to provide the proper level of 
			exercise.

			<h3>Puppy Care</h3>
			<p>
			Puppies are adorable, and quite tempting when one is looking to adopt.
			However, keep in mind that for the first year the amount of care a 
			puppy requires is quite high, almost to the level of a toddler.  If you
			think you will be unable to provide that level of care, please consider
			adopting an older dog.
